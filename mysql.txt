-- 4、查询平均成绩小于60分的同学的学生编号和学生姓名和平均成绩
        -- (包括有成绩的和无成绩的)

select student.s_id,student.s_name,avg(score.s_score) from student,score where student.s_id=score.s_id GROUP BY student.s_id HAVING avg(score.s_score)<60;



-- 5、查询所有同学的学生编号、学生姓名、选课总数、所有课程的总成绩

 
select  student.s_id,student.s_name,count(score.c_id),sum(score.s_score) from student,score where student.s_id=score.s_id GROUP BY student.s_id;

-- 6、查询"李"姓老师的数量
 
select count(teacher.t_name) from teacher where teacher.t_name like '李%';
 

-- 7、查询学过"张三"老师授课的同学的信息 

select student.* from student,score where student.s_id=score.s_id and score.c_id="02";


-- 8、查询没学过"张三"老师授课的同学的信息
 
select * from student a where a.s_id not in(select b.s_id from student b join score c on b.s_id=c.s_id where c.c_id in(select c_id from course where t_id =(select t_id from teacher where t_name = '张三')));
 

-- 9、查询学过编号为"01"并且也学过编号为"02"的课程的同学的信息

select student.* from student,score a,score b where student.s_id = a.s_id  and student.s_id = b.s_id and a.c_id='01' and b.c_id='02';


-- 10、查询学过编号为"01"但是没有学过编号为"02"的课程的同学的信息
 
select student.* from student where student.s_id in (select s_id from score where c_id='01' ) and student.s_id not in(select s_id from score where c_id='02');



-- 11、查询没有学全所有课程的同学的信息
 
select student.* from student where student.s_id in(select s_id from score where s_id not in(select a.s_id from score a join score b on a.s_id = b.s_id and b.c_id='02' join score c on a.s_id = c.s_id and c.c_id='03' where a.c_id='01'));


-- 12、查询至少有一门课与学号为"01"的同学所学相同的同学的信息


 select * from student where s_id in(select distinct score.s_id from score where score.c_id in(select score.c_id from score where score.s_id='01'));


-- 13、查询和"01"号的同学学习的课程完全相同的其他同学的信息


 
select student.* from student where student.s_id in(select distinct s_id from score where s_id!='01' and c_id in(select c_id from score where s_id='01')group by s_id having count(1)=(select count(1) from score where s_id='01')); 

-- 14、查询没学过"张三"老师讲授的任一门课程的学生姓名 
 
select student.s_name from student where student.s_id not in (select s_id from score where c_id = (select c_id from course where t_id =(select t_id from teacher where t_name = '张三'))group by s_id);

 
-- 15、查询两门及其以上不及格课程的同学的学号，姓名及其平均成绩
select student.s_id,student.s_name,round(avg(score.s_score)) from student left join score on student.s_id = score.s_id where student.s_id in(select s_id from score where s_score<60 GROUP BY s_id having count(1)>=2)GROUP BY student.s_id,student.s_name;
